### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jaume from Barcelona, Spain, and I'm a software engineer student with a get-it-done, high-quality mindset. I am really interested in new technologies that will make an impact to society in the future, specially those related to mobile applications. My expertise is in the front-end but I also like to work in the back-end.
